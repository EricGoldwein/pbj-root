# History of PBJ

This page outlines key milestones in the development and evolution of the [Payroll-Based Journal (PBJ)](/pbjpedia/overview), from pre-PBJ staffing surveys through mandatory reporting, public data release, methodological updates, and the 2024 national minimum staffing standard.

PBJ was created to improve transparency and accountability in nursing home staffing by replacing infrequent, self-reported surveys with auditable, daily data. In 1987, the [Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/100th-congress/house-bill/3545) introduced federal requirements for nurse staffing in nursing homes, mandating that a registered nurse or licensed practical/vocational nurse be available around the clock and that a registered nurse serve as director of nursing for at least eight hours per day. Staffing data were collected using the [CMS-671 and CMS-672 survey forms](https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/guidance/transmittals/downloads/r75soma.pdf), which captured staffing for only a two-week period prior to the annual survey. Concerns about over-reporting and limited coverage of these surveys prompted calls for a more robust data collection system.

[The Affordable Care Act (ACA)](https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/3590/text) directed CMS to develop a payroll-based system for collecting nursing home staffing data. CMS published rules outlining the PBJ system and solicited input from providers and vendors. By 2014 CMS finalized the PBJ rule, establishing the framework for electronic submission of staffing information based on payroll and other verifiable data. The first mandatory PBJ reporting period began on July 1, 2016. All Medicare- and Medicaid-certified nursing homes were required to submit daily staffing data for each quarter using the PBJ system. Submissions are due by the end of the 45th calendar day after the quarter closes.

In 2017, CMS began releasing [public use files (PUFs)](https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/4pq5-n9py) containing PBJ staffing data. The PUFs include daily hours for each job category and facility and the resident census derived from [MDS assessments](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/quality/initiatives/patient-assessment-instruments/nursinghomequalityinits/nhqimds30). Researchers, regulators and the public can download these files from [data.cms.gov](https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/4pq5-n9py) and compute staffing metrics such as [hours per resident day](/pbjpedia/metrics). CMS periodically updated PBJ data specifications and exclusion rules. Early PUFs excluded facilities with five or more days without nurse staffing, but later versions revised the exclusion criteria and added separate columns for contract staff. For more information, see [PBJ Methodology](/pbjpedia/methodology).

## Before PBJ

In 1987, the [Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/100th-congress/house-bill/3545) introduced federal requirements for nurse staffing in nursing homes, mandating that a registered nurse or licensed practical/vocational nurse be available around the clock and that a registered nurse serve as director of nursing for at least eight hours per day. Staffing data were collected using the [CMS-671 and CMS-672 survey forms](https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/guidance/transmittals/downloads/r75soma.pdf), which captured staffing for only a two-week period prior to the annual survey. Concerns about over-reporting and limited coverage of these surveys prompted calls for a more robust data collection system.

## 2010 – 2014: Policy Development

[The Affordable Care Act (ACA)](https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/3590/text) directed CMS to develop a payroll-based system for collecting nursing home staffing data. CMS published rules outlining the PBJ system and solicited input from providers and vendors. By 2014 CMS finalized the PBJ rule, establishing the framework for electronic submission of staffing information based on payroll and other verifiable data.

## 2016: Mandatory Reporting Begins

The first mandatory PBJ reporting period began on July 1, 2016. All Medicare- and Medicaid-certified nursing homes were required to submit daily staffing data for each quarter using the [PBJ system](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/quality/initiatives/patient-assessment-instruments/nursinghomequalityinits/staffing-data-submission-payroll-based-journal). Submissions are due by the end of the 45th calendar day after the quarter closes. PBJ collects hours worked for each staff member by job category (e.g., director of nursing, registered nurse, licensed practical nurse, certified nurse aide, medication aide and nurse aide in training).

## 2017: Public Data Release

In 2017, CMS began releasing [public use files (PUFs)](https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/4pq5-n9py) containing PBJ staffing data. The PUFs include daily hours for each job category and facility and the resident census derived from [MDS assessments](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/quality/initiatives/patient-assessment-instruments/nursinghomequalityinits/nhqimds30). Researchers, regulators and the public can download these files from [data.cms.gov](https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/4pq5-n9py) and compute staffing metrics such as [hours per resident day](/pbjpedia/metrics).

## 2018 – 2021: Methodological Updates

CMS periodically updated PBJ data specifications and exclusion rules. Early PUFs excluded facilities with five or more days without nurse staffing, but later versions revised the exclusion criteria and added separate columns for contract staff. Technical specifications also refined how the [MDS-based resident census](/pbjpedia/methodology) is calculated and emphasized that PBJ captures paid hours only. For more information, see [PBJ Methodology](/pbjpedia/methodology) and [Data Limitations](/pbjpedia/data-limitations).

## 2024: National Minimum Staffing Standard (Rescinded)

In April 2024, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a final rule titled [Minimum Staffing Standards for Long-Term Care Facilities and Medicaid Institutional Payment Transparency Reporting](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/medicare-and-medicaid-programs-minimum-staffing-standards-long-term-care-facilities-and-medicaid-0). The rule would have established national minimum staffing requirements for Medicare- and Medicaid-certified nursing homes. It set a baseline of 3.48 total nursing care hours per resident day (HPRD), including 0.55 HPRD of registered nurse (RN) care and 2.45 HPRD of nurse aide care, and required an RN to be onsite 24 hours per day, seven days per week. The rule also included enhanced facility assessment requirements and phased implementation with hardship exemptions.

However, the numerical staffing standards and the 24/7 RN requirement were not implemented. Legal challenges resulted in federal courts vacating key portions of the rule, finding that CMS exceeded its statutory authority.

In December 2025, CMS published an [interim final rule with comment period](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/12/03/2025-21792/medicare-and-medicaid-programs-repeal-of-minimum-staffing-standards-for-long-term-care-facilities) formally rescinding the minimum staffing standards and RN on-site requirements established in 2024. The rescission action reflects a **congressional moratorium (Public Law 119-21) that precludes CMS from implementing, administering, or enforcing those staffing provisions until at least October 1, 2034**, as well as the court decisions invalidating portions of the rule. Under the rescission, CMS restored the prior staffing requirements that existed before the 2024 rule and retained other elements of the 2024 regulation related to facility assessment and Medicaid payment transparency.

**Current status:** As of late 2025, there are no active federal minimum numeric staffing standards for nursing homes comparable to those in the April 2024 rule. Facilities continue to be subject to pre-2024 staffing requirements under existing regulations. For more information, see [State Staffing Standards](/pbjpedia/state-standards).

## Looking Ahead

As PBJ continues to evolve, CMS may modify data submission specifications, exclusion criteria and public reporting methodologies. Proposed regulations on minimum staffing and facility assessments may lead to further changes in how PBJ data are used for quality measurement and enforcement. PBJpedia will be updated as new policies are announced.
