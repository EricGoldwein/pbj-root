# Non-Nursing Staff in PBJ

This page describes non-nursing job categories in the [Payroll-Based Journal (PBJ)](/pbjpedia/overview) system and explains how non-nursing staff hours are reported.

Although PBJ is often discussed in the context of nurse staffing, the system also collects detailed information on non-nursing roles that are essential to nursing home operations. PBJ distinguishes between employees and contract staff and reports hours worked for each job category on each day. Understanding non-nursing staffing patterns can shed light on administrative capacity, clinical oversight and ancillary services.

The [PBJ policy manual](https://www.cms.gov/data-research/statistics-trends-and-reports/payroll-based-journal) assigns standardized job codes to non-nursing positions. Each record in the [public use files](https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/4pq5-n9py) contains total hours, employee hours and contract hours for every category. Key non-nursing categories include administrators, medical directors, physicians, physician assistants, therapists, activities staff, social services, dietitians, housekeeping, laundry, maintenance and other ancillary staff.

Non-nursing staff make up a substantial portion of the workforce in nursing homes. Administrators ensure compliance with regulations; medical directors and attending physicians oversee clinical care; therapists provide rehabilitation services; and support staff such as dietary aides, housekeepers and social workers contribute to residents' daily quality of life. During and after the COVID-19 pandemic, reliance on contract staff increased in many facilities, highlighting the importance of tracking contract hours for both nursing and non-nursing categories. PBJ enables analyses of contract reliance by role, state and facility type.

## Job Categories

The [PBJ policy manual](https://www.cms.gov/data-research/statistics-trends-and-reports/payroll-based-journal) assigns standardized job codes to non-nursing positions. Each record in the [public use files](https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/4pq5-n9py) contains total hours, employee hours and contract hours for every category. Key non-nursing categories include:

| Job Code | Role | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| 1 | **Administrator** | Responsible for overall facility management. PBJ excludes administrator hours if five or more administrators are reported on four or more days. |
| 2 | **Medical Director** | Oversees medical care. Hours may be low because services are often billed to Medicare or other insurers rather than paid by the facility. |
| 3 | **Other Physician** | Physicians not serving as medical director. Hours may be low because services are typically billed separately. |
| 4 | **Physician Assistant (PA)** | Non-physician practitioner providing clinical services. |
| 5+ | **Additional Non-Nursing Roles** | The PBJ policy manual includes categories for activities staff, social services, dietitians, housekeeping, laundry, maintenance, therapy (physical, occupational and speech), and other ancillary staff. These roles contribute to resident well-being and facility operations. |

Each non-nursing role is reported separately for total hours, employee hours and contract hours, allowing analysts to assess the extent of contract staffing across functional areas.

## Significance

Non-nursing staff make up a substantial portion of the workforce in nursing homes. Administrators ensure compliance with regulations; medical directors and attending physicians oversee clinical care; therapists provide rehabilitation services; and support staff such as dietary aides, housekeepers and social workers contribute to residents' daily quality of life. During and after the COVID-19 pandemic, reliance on contract staff increased in many facilities, highlighting the importance of tracking contract hours for both nursing and non-nursing categories. PBJ enables analyses of contract reliance by role, state and facility type.

Hours reported for physicians and non-physician practitioners may be low because these services are typically billed to Medicare or other insurers rather than paid by the facility. For more information, see [Data Limitations](/pbjpedia/data-limitations).
