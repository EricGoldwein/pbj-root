# State Staffing Standards

This page summarizes minimum staffing requirements for nursing homes in federal and state policy. For an overview of PBJ and how it measures staffing, see [PBJ Overview](/pbjpedia/overview).

## Federal Baseline

Since 1987, CMS has required nursing facilities to have a registered nurse (RN) or licensed practical/vocational nurse (LPN/LVN) available 24 hours a day and a RN-level director of nursing onsite for at least eight hours per day. For a typical 100-bed facility, this federal staffing requirement translates to roughly 0.3 hours per resident day (HPRD). In 2001, a CMS expert panel recommended 0.75 HPRD of RN staffing and 4.1 HPRD of total direct care staffing (RNs, LPNs/LVNs and CNAs) to reduce the risk of harm to residents. These recommendations remain influential but are not mandatory; many facilities operate below these levels.

## State Variation

States have considerable flexibility to set staffing standards that exceed the federal baseline. Analysis conducted for MACPAC in 2021 found that thirty-eight states and the District of Columbia have minimum staffing standards exceeding the federal requirement of 0.3 HPRD. Standards vary substantially, with some states requiring less than 2.0 HPRD and others requiring more than 3.0 HPRD. The District of Columbia sets the highest minimum at 4.1 HPRD—the level recommended by CMS's 2001 study.

## Federal Minimum Staffing Rule (2024, Rescinded)

In April 2024, CMS issued a final rule that would have established a national minimum staffing standard for long-term care facilities. However, the numerical staffing standards and the 24/7 RN requirement were not implemented due to legal challenges and a congressional moratorium. As of late 2025, there are no active federal minimum numeric staffing standards for nursing homes comparable to those in the April 2024 rule.
